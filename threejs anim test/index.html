        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>
          Let me introduce myself: I'm David Prok and I like programming,
          learning and trying out new ideas - to make use of my creativity in
          any way.
          <br />
          The purpose of this webpage sample is to give a visual representation
          of some of my programming skills.
          <br />
          However, I'd like to seize the opportunity to share some personal
          info, too, like hobbies, activities and goals apart from programming.
        </p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          I think I'm a good teamplayer, proactive, creative, empathic and
          loyal. About Einstein's citation, here are some 'Monday motivation'
          thoughts:
          <br />
          Both success and value can be measured by our actions made, our
          achievements and goals reached. Both may be subjective to one's own
          point of view, morals and ideals.
          <br />
          However, while former is often associated mostly with one's private
          interests, latter is much more about the overall feedback and
          well-being of the people around. In these days, success is a bit
          overemphasized to a level of being the main source of everyday stress,
          having to prove ourselves to the world.
          <br />
          On the contrary, when it comes to value - which is often overlooked
          because of that constant pressure - we usually lose sight of what
          really matters: enjoying our job, helping others and making precious
          memories with our team or others we know. Real success is not only
          about ourselves, but about success on different levels: doing our part
          in a team of colleagues, the whole nation, society, etc.
          <br />
          So let's try not to become just a man of success. Let's not lose sight
          of who we are.

          I'm a self-learning programmer, looking for junior jobs, mostly in
          frontend.
          <br />
          In 2014, I've decided to start using macros (VBA) to better serve my
          colleagues' needs by simplifying and speeding up (HR and accounting
          related) administrative tasks significantly. I've reached a mid-level
          in about 2 years, reading documentations and experimenting on
          over-complicated, time-consuming and monotonic work processes.
          <br />
          It was some years ago, when I started to learn programming more
          intensively and also in a wider range.
          <br />
          First, I was about to gain general knowledge with Python - and PyGame,
          for the fun part. Mostly using Tkinter/ttk GUIs for my desktop apps
          ever since then, but also tried out Kivy/kv in Java. For databases, I
          use SQL, MySql (or JSON, on web), SQLite - and a bit of PHP, for
          contact, guestbooks and such. My Python is on a stable intermediate
          level. As for web development, my favourite is React, but I got to
          know Flask, too.
          <br />
          After several template projects for my CV/portfolio, my Javascript
          (Node.js) skills have improved a lot. Besides vanilla Javascript
          (simple 2D canvas animations), recently I started to turn towards this
          specific kind of web animations (3D scene) with ThreeJS.
          <br />
          I'm using (in order of preference) VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text,
          Notepad++ for coding and Git/GitHub for storing, handling, updating my
          code and stuff. Prettier and ESLint keep my code clean, easy-to-read.
        </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of
          the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid
          island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was
          not meant that we should voyage far.
          <br />
          The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto
          harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated
          knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our
          frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the
          revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new
          dark age."

        <h2>Freetime Activities / Hobbies</h2>

        <h3>Poems</h3>
        <p>
          I've been writing poems since I was 15 years old. They function as
          quasi diary for me - as a way to air out my feelings and thoughts from
          time to time. They are usually publicated on poetry related websites,
          but some of them have showed up in a dozen of antologies. Among all,
          my own published volume of poetry I'm the most proud of.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
          Reading has always been important for me, be it novels, poems, comics
          or magazines. I love sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, horror, historical or
          any kind of interesting stories. Besides being food for thoughts and
          imagination, reading is a good relaxation practice and helps improving
          vocabulary, too. Anyway, it's fun.
        </p>

        <h3>Sci-fi, astronomy</h3>
        <p>
          As were mentioned above in connection with books and reading: I
          especially fond of astronomy and our vast universe. Therefore, it goes
          without saying that scientific educational and documentary films, plus
          all thought-provoking, sci-fi genre movies are close to my heart, to
          say the least.
        </p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
          I find great pleasure in nature/landscape photography and have made
          some success in photo contests (calendars), too.
        </p>

        <h3>Hiking, cycling</h3>
        <p>
          Nature is important to me, hiking fills me with joy. In nature there's
          always something beautiful to see, some interesting animal species in
          their habitats to observe - and being said above, to take a photo of.
          As for pets, I prefer dogs.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          Not being so genre-specific, I listen to various music genres. But, of
          course, there are times when one becomes fan of some specific genres.
          Nowadays my absolute favourites are the retro synthwave tunes, along
          with melodic sorts of techno, minimal, dupstep, etc.
