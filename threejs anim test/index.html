        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>
          Let me introduce myself: I'm David Prok and I like programming,
          learning and trying out new ideas - to make use of my creativity in
          any way.
          <br />
          The purpose of this webpage sample is to give a visual representation
          of some of my programming skills.
          <br />
          However, I'd like to seize the opportunity to share some personal
          info, too, like hobbies, activities and goals apart from programming.
        </p>

          "#SUCCESS can be measured by your achievements and goals reached.
          There is a formula for calculating success which may be subjective to
          every person's points of view and ideals. But today, success isn't
          just about self-contentment. It is more about how people would see
          you, how people would look up to you as an inspiration. It isn't a
          hard nut to crack. It's a combination of luck and grit.
          <br />
          When it comes to #VALUE, which is often overlooked because you are
          busy trying to prove yourself to the world â€” you lose sight of what
          matters. Enjoying your work, loving your job and making precious
          memories with your team or the people around you.
          <br />
          So try not to become JUST a man of success. Don't lose sight of who
          you are. Live happily. Enjoy every moment. At the end of the day,
          you'll realize success is at every corner of every day by making
          yourself and everyone valued and happy.

          I'm a self-learning programmer, looking for junior jobs, mostly in
          frontend.
          <br />
          In 2014, I've decided to start using macros (VBA) to better serve my
          colleagues' needs by simplifying and speeding up (HR and accounting
          related) administrative tasks significantly. I've reached a mid-level
          in about 2 years, reading documentations and experimenting on
          over-complicated, time-consuming and monotonic work processes.
          <br />
          It was some years ago, when I started to learn programming more
          intensively and however in a wider range, too.
          <br />
          First, I was about to gain general knowledge with Python - and PyGame,
          for the fun part. Mostly using Tkinter/ttk GUIs for my desktop apps
          ever since then, but also tried out Kivy/kv in Java. For databases, I
          use SQL, MySql (or JSON, on web), SQLite - and a bit of PHP, for
          contact, guestbooks and such. My Python is on a stable intermediate
          level. As for web development, my favourite is React, but I got to
          know Flask, too.
          <br />
          After several template projects for my CV/portfolio, my Javascript
          (Node.js) skills have improved a lot. Besides vanilla Javascript
          (simple 2D canvas animations), recently I started to turn towards this
          specific kind of web animations (3D scene) with ThreeJS.
          <br />
          I use (in order of preference) VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text,
          Notepad++, IntelliJ IDEA (just Java). Git or rather GitHub for
          storing, handling, updating my code and stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of
          the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid
          island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was
          not meant that we should voyage far.
          <br />
          The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto
          harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated
          knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our
          frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the
          revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new
          dark age."
