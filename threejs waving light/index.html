          "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of
          the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid
          island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was
          not meant that we should voyage far.
          <br />
          The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto
          harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated
          knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our
          frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the
          revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new
          dark age."
          <br />
          - H.P. Lovecraft
